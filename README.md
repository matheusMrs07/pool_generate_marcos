    Exploring diversity in data complexity and classifier decision spaces for pool generation
</h1>


<p>
This project presents a method for classifier pool generation in which a two-level strategy explores
diversity in both data complexity and classifier decision spaces. The rationale is to induce pool members
using data subsets representing subproblems with different difficulties while promoting diversity in classifiers‚Äô
decisions. Two possible variants of the proposed method with a focus on maximum dispersion and maximum
accuracy are presented. These differ in the property used to define the best pool of classifiers provided by an
optimization process. A robust experimental protocol encompassing 28 classification datasets shows that the
proposed pool generation provided the best accuracy on 327 over 336 experiments (97.3%) when compared to
well-known pool generation methods to provide multiple classifier systems with and without dynamic selection

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configura√ß√µes do Projeto 

To run this project, you will need to configure the following variables:
- `group`: Group of Complexities used to generate the bags.
    ``` python
    pool_generate.group = ["overlapping", 'neighborhood']
    ```
- `types`: complexity indices that will be used.
     ``` python
    pool_generate.types = ["F1", 'T1']
    ```
- `method_disperse`: indicates the method of choosing the best bag, True indicates the distance method, False indicates the Accuracy method.
    ``` python
    pool_generate.method_disperse = True
    ```
- `fit_value`: indicates the fit value of the variables of the disperse method. The value varies between 1.0 and -1.0
     ```python
    pool_generate.fit_value1 = 1.0
    pool_generate.fit_value2 = 1.0
    pool_generate.fit_value3 = -1.0
    ```
- `nr_generation`: Number of bags generations
    ```python
    pool_generarte.nr_generation = 19
    ```


- ``nr_individual``: Number of bags resulting from a generation

- `nr_pop`: size of the initial population of bags.

- `proba_crossover`: Probability of a crossover occurring within a generation.
- `proba_mutation`: Probability of a Mutation occurring during a generation.

- `nr_child`: Number of children created during a generation

- `stop_criteria`: criteria for choosing the best bag. It can be "maxdistance", to use the distance between the variables or "maxacc" to use the accuracy of the bag as a criterion.

- `classifier`: Classifier used to identify the bag with better accuracy, to use decision tree use "tree", to use perceptron user "perc".


- `tam_bags`: Percentage of the base reserved for training.

- `nr_bags`: number of bags generated.

- `bags_saved`: variable that stores the generated bags


### üí° Fun√ß√µes

The project provides the following functions:
- `class poolGeneration(method_disperse=True, fit_value=[1.0, 1.0, -1.0], nr_generation=20, nr_individual=100, nr_pop=100, proba_crossover=0.9, proba_mutation=0.1, nr_child=100, iteration = 20, stop_criteria = "maxdistance", classifier = "tree", tam_bags = 0.5, nr_bags = 100)`: Initialization function, variables are described in the previous section.
    ``` python
    pool_generate = poolGeneration()
    ```

- `generate(X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val, iteration = 20)`: Receives the database, divided into training and testing and the number of interactions that the pool generate will do. This function is responsible for processing data and generating bags.
     ``` python
    generate(X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val, iteration = 20)
    ```
- `get_bags()`: Returns the bags generated by the class.
     ``` python
     pool_generate.get_bags()
     # [(bag_1), (bag_2), ..., (bag_n)]
     ```
- `get_pool()`: Returns the pool of classifiers generated by the class.
     ``` python
     pool_generate.get_pool()
     # [[(classificador_1), (classificador_2), ..., (classificador_n)]]
     ```
